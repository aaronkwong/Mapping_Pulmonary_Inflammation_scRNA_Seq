## Abstract

Ischemia reperfusion (IR) is an unavoidable step of organ transplantation. IR-induced injury constrains the number of donor lungs used for transplant. Here we performed longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing from the lungs of six individuals who underwent lung transplantation. Lung biopsies were collected after cold preservation and 2-hour reperfusion resulting in the profiling of 108,613 cells in total. Inflammatory responses from donor lung macrophages were found after reperfusion with upregulation of multiple cytokines and chemokines, especially IL1 and IL1. Interestingly, significant inflammatory responses were found in alveolar epithelial cells (featured by CXCL8) and lung endothelial cells (featured by IL6 upregulation). Different inflammatory responses were noted between donor and recipient monocytes and effector CD8 T cells. Reperfusion activated cell-cell interactions via cytokines/chemokines and their receptors. Donor and recipient cells derived distinct cell-cell interactions. The importance of lung epithelial and endothelial cells in IR injury and the differential inflammatory signals from donor versus recipient cells provide clues for understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of IR-induced lung injury, and further investigations may lead to development of novel therapeutics.
